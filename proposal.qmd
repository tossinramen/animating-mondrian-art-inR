**High level goal**: Our main goal with this project is to explore how Mondrian’s art can be illustrated and transformed with ggplot2.

**A one to two paragraph description of your goals, including your motivation.**

(expand this) We also hope to explore the relationships between his works by transforming each piece into the next. We’ll do this by animating the process of expanding boxes, changing positions and colors.

**A weekly “plan of attack” outlining your steps to complete your project and including the team member(s) assigned to that task.**

**The final organization of your project repository. This means describing the project organization in your proposal as well as implementing that organization in your repo. Create any folders needed and place a `README.md` in each folder explaining what goes in there.**
