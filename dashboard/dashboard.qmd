**Introduction**\

Our project, "Animating Mondrian," is an exploratory venture into the
transformation of Piet Mondrian's art using `ggplot2` and `gganimate`
within the R programming environment. Piet Mondrian, a pioneer in the
development of modern abstract art and a major proponent of the Dutch
abstract art movement De Stijl, used non-representational
forms‚Äîprimarily rectangles, squares, and lines‚Äîand a restricted palette
of primary colors and non-colors. His works, which offer a rich field
for digital reinterpretation, underscore our project's goal to animate
transitions between his artworks. This not only visualizes the evolution
of his art but provides a new perspective on understanding and
interacting with abstract compositions.

**Historical Context and Motivation**\

Piet Mondrian's art was profoundly influenced by his desire to express
the spiritual through the abstract. Initially inspired by the landscape
of Brabant, where he noted the interplay of lines and colors in nature,
his work progressively embraced abstraction. The influence of
Post-Impressionists and his exposure to the dynamism of American jazz
and city life in New York further fueled his abstract expressions. Our
motivation stems from a fascination with Mondrian‚Äôs ability to convey
deep aesthetic and philosophical meaning through minimalistic visual
elements. We aim to demystify the static nature of his paintings, using
animations to hypothesize the dynamic processes potentially envisioned
in Mondrian's creative mind.

**Technical Implementation**\

To delve into Mondrian‚Äôs abstract world, we recreated three significant
artworks: "Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow", "Composition N.10",
and "Composition with Yellow, Blue, and Red". These digital
reproductions served as the groundwork for our animations, which were
crafted using `gganimate` to simulate transitions that bring the
evolution of Mondrian's art to life. This involved dynamically altering
line segments and color fields to morph one painting into another,
highlighting the fluidity and transformative potential within the bounds
of geometric abstraction.

These animations not only serve to illustrate Mondrian's artistic
evolution but also emphasize the simplicity and power of minimalist art
in conveying complex ideas. Through this technical endeavor, we observed
how subtle modifications in geometric forms and their interactions could
dramatically alter visual perception and convey movement and growth.

**Interactive Application**\

To extend the project‚Äôs educational and exploratory dimensions, we
developed an interactive application that allows users to manipulate the
elements of Mondrian's compositions. This tool empowers users to alter
the number of lines, adjust their orientations, modify the color
schemes, and shift positions, thus offering a hands-on experience of
Mondrian's methods and artistic decisions. This interactive component is
designed to deepen the user's understanding of neoplasticism by enabling
them to explore and experiment with its defining features actively.

**Conclusion**\

"Animating Mondrian" combines historical art analysis with modern
technological tools, showcasing how digital media can offer fresh
insights into well-established art forms. This project not only enhanced
our skills in animation and data visualization but also deepened our
appreciation of the complexities inherent in abstract art. By converting
static images into dynamic sequences, we invite viewers to engage with
Mondrian‚Äôs work in a novel and interactive manner, thus broadening the
accessibility and understanding of his art through the lens of data
visualization.

The project repository, detailed with codes, datasets, and outputs, is
structured to facilitate easy exploration of our methods and findings,
offering a resource for those interested in the intersection of art and
technology. This endeavor represents not just a technical achievement
but also a new paradigm for interdisciplinary education, promoting a
deeper appreciation of art in the digital age.

In conclusion, "Animating Mondrian" is more than a mere academic
exercise; it is a bridge connecting the past with the present, inviting
art lovers and technologists alike to explore the beauty and complexity
of Mondrian‚Äôs legacy through modern visualization techniques. Through
this project, we have laid a foundation for future explorations into the
digital representation of abstract art, hoping to inspire others to
explore this enriching field.

# About the Art

**The Artist**

![](images/Piet_Mondriaan.jpg){width="2in"}

Piet Mondrian (born March 7, 1872, Amersfoort, Netherlands‚Äîdied February
1, 1944, New York, New York, U.S.) was a painter who was an important
leader in the development of modern abstract art, also largely
responsible for the art movement known as "De Stijl."

Initially influenced by the serene landscapes of Brabant (Belgium) while
visiting a friend, Mondrian's early works displayed a rhythmic framework
and compositional structure. Upon returning to Holland, his vision
shifted towards abstraction, marked by a pursuit of harmony and rhythm
through line and color. He had a new rhythmic framework, leaning more
toward compositional structure than toward the traditional picturesque
values of light and shade. In "The Red Tree" (1908), for example,
Mondrian captured his unique interpretation of nature by balancing
contrasting colors of red and blue. This harmony is also reflected in
the dynamic motion of the tree against the calmness of the blue sky.
Through this contrast, Mondrian achieved a sense of equilibrium, a theme
that would continue to guide his depiction of the natural world. Even
so, for a while, Mondrian's work still remained more or less within the
traditional boundaries of contemporary Dutch art.

After some time, he shifted towards neoplasticism, liberating his art
from representing fleeting visual perceptions and his personal
temperament; he now expressed "a true vision of reality", which he
sought to convey harmony through completely abstract rules of geometry
and color. This shift is reflected in his titles, which transitioned
from descriptive references to nature or architecture to more abstract
compositions ("The Red Tree" vs. "Diagonal Composition").

Upon his move to New York City in 1940, Mondrian's art was invigorated
by the city's vibrant energy and the rhythms of American music. He
departed from his earlier austere patterns of black lines, embracing
colored bands and small rectangles that coalesced into dynamic
compositions of vertical and horizontal lines.

Mondrian's artistic journey encapsulates a progression from
representational elements towards pure abstraction, driven by a desire
to convey a deeper spiritual message. His innovative use of line, color,
and form continues to inspire artists and audiences alike, cementing his
legacy as a groundbreaking figure in the history of art ("Piet
Mondrian", Britannica).

**"Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow" (1930)**

![](images/Mondrian%201.jpg){fig-alt="An abstract painting by Piet Mondrian with black lines forming a grid of rectangles and squares. The shapes are filled with primary colors: red, blue, and yellow, along with white spaces. The composition is balanced yet asymmetrical."
width="5in"}

"Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow" by Piet Mondrian, created in
1930, represents a culmination of the artist's exploration of
neoplasticism. The clean lines and simple geometric forms reflect
Mondrian's move away from earlier styles that included landscapes and
portraits, as well as his more abstract and cubist works. This painting
encapsulates the essence of Mondrian's signature style: the use of
primary colors, stark lines, as well as an emphasis on balance and order
(Gurney).

**"Composition N. 10" (1940?)**

![](images/Mondrian%202.jpg){width="5in"}

"Composition No. 10" by Piet Mondrian, loosely dated from 1939 to 1942,
marks a significant evolution in the artist's neoplasticist period. The
painting reflects his characteristic geometric shapes and bold primary
colors, with black lines used to separate color planes. This approach
creates a balanced harmony between mathematics, abstractionism, and
aesthetics.

However, "Composition No. 10" stands out because it represents a pivotal
moment in Mondrian's style, shifting from earlier works that relied on
more square-like formats to those with longer rectangular sections. In
addition to its structural changes, "Composition No. 10" demonstrates
Mondrian's innovative use of color and space. The thicker black lines
and larger rectangular formats allow for greater flexibility and
experimentation, making it one of his most iconic works from the
neoplasticist period ("Composition No. 10 (1939-1942) by Piet Mondrian ‚Äì
Artchive").

**"Composition with Yellow, Blue and Red" (1942)**

![](images/Mondrian%203.jpg){width="5in"}

"Composition with Yellow, Blue, and Red" was begun in 1937-38 while Piet
Mondrian was in Holland and completed in 1941-42 after his move to New
York City. This is a significant piece within Mondrian's body of work,
for it bridges his European roots with his American evolution.

Regarding Paris, we can see similarities with "Composition with Red,
Blue and Yellow" (image 1), like the use of primary colors and box-like
structures. As mentioned previously, these familiar geometric shapes and
simple color palettes are hallmarks of his neoplasticist style.

At the same time, "Composition with Yellow, Blue, and Red" begins to
explore the broader use of rectangular formats, similar to "Composition
No. 10." This expansion into larger rectangular spaces suggests a shift
in Mondrian's approach to structure and balance, a characteristic that
emerged as he moved from Europe to the United States.

Besides the broader shapes, there's also a noticeable influence from
Mondrian's New York period. In contrast to his earlier works, we start
seeing colored line segments, which run between longer black lines or
from a black line to the edge of the canvas; they add a sense of
movement and breaking the rigidity of the original grid structure. This
clearly illustrates how Mondrian's time in New York influenced his
evolving style, leading to more dynamic and visually engaging
compositions.

Overall, "Composition with Yellow, Blue, and Red" encapsulates a
transition in Mondrian's work, maintaining the bold primary colors and
linear structure from his Paris period while exploring larger
rectangular formats and colored line segments that reflect the artist's
experience and influence during his time in New York (‚ÄúComposition with
Yellow, Blue and Red‚Äù, Britannica).
