# Description
Our project, in which we animate Mondrian's art, is a venture into the transformation of Piet Mondrian's art using `ggplot2` and `gganimate` with R. Piet Mondrian, a pioneer in the development of modern abstract art and a major proponent of the Dutch abstract art movement De Stijl, used non-representational forms—primarily rectangles, squares, and lines—and a restricted palette of primary colors and non-colors. His works, which offer a rich field for digital reinterpretation, underscore our project's goal to animate transitions between his artworks. This not only visualizes the evolution of his art but provides a new perspective on understanding and interacting with abstract compositions.

Our inspiration comes from our admiration for Mondrian's capacity to use spare visual components to express profound aesthetic and philosophical meaning. By employing animations to conjecture the dynamic processes that Mondrian's creative mind could have imagined, we hope to dispel the mystery surrounding the static quality of his paintings.

Our final product is a dashboard and an app that allows users to customize the artwork by adding horizontal and vertical lines, changing the color scheme, and moving the lines of artwork. The dashboard displays information about Piet Mondrian, his artwork, our recreation of his artwork, our animation of the artwork, and our app hat lets users customize his artwork.

# Data
We created our own dataset for this project using ggplot2. Our datasets can be found in the image-datasets folder.
